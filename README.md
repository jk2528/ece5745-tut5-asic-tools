ECE 5745 Tutorial 5: Synopsys ASIC Tools
==========================================================================

This repository contains the code and documentation for ECE 5745 Tutorial
5 on the Synopsys ASIC tools. This tutorial discusses the various views
that make-up a standard-cell library and then illustrates how to use the
Synopsys ASIC tools to map an RTL design down to these standard cells and
ultimately silicon. The tutorial discusses the key tools used for
synthesis, place-and-route, and power analysis. This tutorial requires
entering commands manually for each of the tools to enable students to
gain a better understanding of the detailed steps involved in this
process. The next tutorial will illustrate how this process can be
automated to facilitate rapid design-space exploration. This tutorial
assumes you have already completed the tutorials on Linux, Git, PyMTL,
and Verilog.
